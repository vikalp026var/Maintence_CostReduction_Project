for Hackathon Project (Starlab Captial)



# Maintenance Cost Reduction Project

## Overview
This Maintenance Cost Reduction project aims to harness the power of machine learning to predict potential equipment failures, thereby enabling proactive maintenance strategies. By predicting failures before they occur, this project helps in significantly reducing downtime and maintenance costs, improving equipment longevity and operational efficiency.

## Features
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Automated processes for gathering and preparing data for analysis, ensuring it's clean and relevant.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth analysis to uncover patterns and insights within the data, guiding the predictive modeling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creation and selection of meaningful features from the data to improve model performance.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Utilizing various machine learning algorithms to train models and rigorously evaluate their performance to ensure reliability.
- **Prediction Module:** Deployment of the trained model to predict equipment failures, facilitating timely maintenance actions.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- Python 3.8
- pip (Python package manager)
- virtualenv (optional, for creating an isolated environment)

## Installation
